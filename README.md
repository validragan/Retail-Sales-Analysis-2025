This project demonstrates a basic retail sales analysis workflow using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.

## Structure

- `dashboard/sales_top10.png` – bar chart of top products by sales
- `dashboard/sales_trends.png` – monthly sales trend line chart

## How to Run
1. Open `notebooks/sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells (`Cell → Run All`)
3. Figures will be saved in the `dashboard/` folder
